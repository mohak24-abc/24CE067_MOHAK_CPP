/*
In a bid to design an efficient and user-friendly banking system, 
a structure was proposed that mirrors the real-world operations of 
various account types. The foundation of the system is a base class 
representing a generic bank account, encapsulating essential details 
such as account number and balance. Building on this foundation, two 
specialized account types were created: a savings account, which 
includes an interest rate as an additional feature, and a current 
account, which allows an overdraft limit to accommodate specific 
customer needs.
To ensure proper initialization and cleanup of account objects, 
constructors and destructors were implemented. Essential banking 
operations such as deposits and withdrawals were made available for 
both account types, allowing users to perform and manage their 
transactions effectively. The system also accounted for the need to 
track and manage transaction history, enabling operations such as 
undoing the last transaction. This was achieved by simulating a 
mechanism to store a sequence of transactions for each account type, 
providing insight into different ways of managing and organizing data.
