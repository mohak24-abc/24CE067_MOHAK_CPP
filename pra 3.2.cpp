/*
A software development company was tasked with conducting a performance analysis of recursive algorithms versus
their iterative counterparts. The specific focus was on calculating the Sum of integers in an array, where the
array's size and elements were to be provided dynamically by the user. To facilitate memory management and enable
dynamic resizing of the array, the team decided to use a flexible container for storing the array elements.
The system was designed to first prompt users for the array's size and then request the input of individual elements.
A recursive function was to be implemented to compute the Sum by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems,
recursively summing subsets of the array until reaching the base case. In addition to the recursive implementation,
an iterative version of the function would be created for comparison.
The main objective of the study was to assess and compare the computational performance and implementation complexity
of both recursive and non-recursive approaches. By evaluating execution times, memory usage, and code complexity,
the team hoped to gain insights into the trade-offs between recursion and iteration, particularly in terms of efficiency
and applicability to real-world problems.
