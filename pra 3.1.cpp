/*
A growing organization sought to enhance its payroll process to improve accuracy
and efficiency in calculating employee salaries. The goal was to manage details
such as the employee's Name, Basic salary, and Bonus amount. While most employees
would receive a default Bonus, there was a need for flexibility to provide customized
bonuses for exceptional performers or those in specialized roles. To ensure real-time
computation of each employee's total salary, the system would dynamically calculate
the total salary by adding the Basic salary and the Bonus. An inline function was
chosen for this task, allowing the system to compute the total salary instantly during
processing. The system was designed to initialize employee records using a constructor,
where the Bonus could either be set to a default value or adjusted according to specific
employee criteria. As the organization expanded, managing employee records efficiently
became a key consideration. The solution involved
//storing employee details dynamically//,
ensuring the system could handle a growing number of records while maintaining
//scalability and flexibility//.
Each employee record would include their personal details, Basic salary, and Bonus
information, with the system displaying a breakdown of each employee’s details along
with their total salary.
