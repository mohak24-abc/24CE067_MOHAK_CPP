A data analytics company was tasked with developing a unique digital
signature system based on the concept of "super digits." The system
required finding a single-digit representation of a given number
through recursive digit summation. The algorithm was defined as follows:
If the number has only one digit, it is its super digit. Otherwise,
the super digit is the super digit of the sum of its digits, repeated
recursively until a single digit is obtained.
The challenge involved an additional complexity—constructing the number
by concatenating a given string representation of an integer multiple
times. For example, if the number n was represented as a string and
concatenated k times, the super digit of the resulting number needed
to be calculated.
For instance:
Given n = 9875 and k = 4, the number is represented as 9875987598759875.
The sum of digits in this number is calculated recursively until a
single digit remains:
9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 116
1 + 1 + 6 = 8
The super digit is 8.
The system was required to handle large numbers efficiently by leveraging
mathematical insights rather than explicitly constructing large concatenated
strings. This case study called for implementing a recursive solution to
calculate the super digit, supported by a mathematical approach to optimize
the handling of repeated sums.
