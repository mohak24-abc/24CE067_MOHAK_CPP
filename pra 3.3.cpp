/*
A community bank sought to enhance its account management system with
a digital solution to improve efficiency and provide better customer
service. The system was required to manage the essential details of
each account, including the account number, account holder’s name,
and balance. Additionally, the bank wanted to provide a secure mechanism
for transferring money between accounts, allowing customers to easily
manage their funds.
The bank also needed a way to track the total number of accounts created,
which would be important for generating reports and understanding the growth
of their customer base. This feature was aimed at helping the bank maintain
an overview of their account portfolio and analyze trends over time.
To ensure smooth and reliable operations, the system was designed to store
account information in a way that would allow easy access and updates.
When new accounts were created, they would be added to the system dynamically.
The management team planned for future scalability and performance improvements
by considering more efficient storage and retrieval methods after the initial
system was built, ensuring that the bank could easily accommodate more
accounts and transactions as the customer base grew.
