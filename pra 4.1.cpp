/*
A team of engineers was tasked with developing a program to calculate
and manage the areas of multiple circles for a design project. To
achieve this, they devised a solution using a structured, object-oriented
approach. At the foundation of their solution was a base class that
represented a generic shape, responsible for storing and managing the
radius of the circle. Building upon this, a specialized class for
circles was created to extend functionality by introducing a method
for calculating the area of a circle based on its radius. Using this
framework, the team designed a system to handle multiple circles,
ensuring that the process of storing, calculating, and displaying
the areas was efficient and adaptable. They explored two different
approaches for managing the collection of circles—one focusing on
flexibility and dynamic handling, while the other used a more static
structure. By implementing and comparing these methods, the engineers
gained insights into the benefits of using efficient techniques for
organizing and processing geometric data, enhancing their problem-solving
capabilities.
